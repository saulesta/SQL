# Welcome to My SQL Projects Repository!

Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to showcasing my work on various SQL projects. Here, you'll find a collection of SQL projects and their queries that I've developed as part of my journey in mastering SQL.

## About Me

I am passionate about data analytics and have been honing my skills in SQL to extract meaningful insights from data. My journey into SQL began during my studies at Vilnius University and continued at Vilnius Coding School, where I completed a full-time Data Analytics course in January 2024.

### Repository Contents

In this repository, you'll find a diverse range of SQL projects that demonstrate my proficiency in working with databases, manipulating data, and conducting analysis. Among these projects, you'll find:

#### Final Project from Vilnius Coding School: 
The file named "final" contains exercises that I completed during the final examination of the Data Analytics course at Vilnius Coding School. 

#### Data Management course exercises in university:
The file named "database management" contains lines of code that represent a culmination of the skills and knowledge I acquired throughout the university course.

### Overall
As I'm pretty new to this computational skill, SQL is one of my strongest abilities, that I feel the most comfortable. Throughout my studies, I could say that I have gathered extensive knowledge of SQL commands such as SELECT, WHERE, HAVING, JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, MAX/MIN/AVG, COUNT, CASE, SUBQUERY, CONCAT, SUBSTR, TRIM, REPLACE, LEN, LOCATE, ROUND, TRUNCATE(number/date) and more. These commands allow me to effectively manage and query databases, making SQL a fundamental aspect of my capabilities.
